By continuing to file this new issue / feature request, I confirm I have :
1. searched issues for the same issue I have and will include links to similar issues explaining why mine is different
2. searched the [live NEWS file](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/blob/master/NEWS.md) to see if it has been fixed in dev already. If so, I tried the [latest dev version](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Installation#windows).
3. searched and asked on [Stack Overflow's data.table tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/data.table) and will provide a link to the question(s)
4. read the [Support](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Support) and [Contributing](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Contributing) guides
5. used tags under the labels menu on the right of this page, not text prefixes in the title
